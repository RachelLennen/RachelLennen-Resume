        <p class="lead mb-4">My professional experience includes working at a summer camp in Cupertino. My role as Senior Recreation Leader included organizing paperwork, making schedules, and leading games. This job required a lot of leadership skills such as public speaking, organization, time management and good communication. Whenever my camp had a field trip time management and good communication with parents was always necessary. My favorite part of the job was the fact that running the camp was a team effort. I have always been a team player so this job was ideal. I got to work with people of all ages whether it be my fellow teenaged coworkers, the young campers, or my older bosses. Because I have worked here for 3 years at the training session I helped lead an activity about how to explain games to kids as well as how to properly prepare for field trips to new leaders. Prior to getting this job I volunteered at the camp as a leader in training to gain some experience before applying for the job.<br><br>

        In high school I was a producer of a show we did called Monta Vista Saturday Night Live. I helped market not only to get people to audition but also marketed the show itself and sold tickets. For the show I had to check in on eighteen sketches to make sure that everyone had their props, costumes, and tech elements set up for the actual show. During the actual show I did all of the sound cues due to my experience as sound technician for several shows as well as the rallys at my high school. I also contacted 2 teachers to participate in the show as hosts and actors. The only money that we spent on the show was to make the programs and the tickets, otherwise we used set and props that we already had so financing was not an issue. Overall, this experience helped me with organization and public speaking significantly because at some points I had to talk to an auditorium of hundreds of people. Putting on such a large event made me realize how many elements go into putting something together and what steps I need to take to organize my time to be successful at what Iâ€™m doing.
<br><br>

        Right now I am taking a personal finance class and I have been to several finance and business related events at UC Riverside. I have a lot of basic knowledge of various business elements such as financing and management. I am planning on concentrating on finance in the future because it has a good amount of math and business elements together. Personal finance includes a lot of important life skills that I can teach others such as how to do your taxes, how to properly mortgage a house, and how to create a plan towards financial happiness. I am also taking Econ 3 which means I have a good understanding of supply and demand curves and how certain elements like price affect a market. This can help a business determine how to market their goods and how to maximize profits.
